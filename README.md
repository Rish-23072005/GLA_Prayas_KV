# GLA_Prayas_KV
Project for GLA Admission Team Prayas

In this project, I've developed a system that processes handwritten forms, extracts the content, and saves it into an Excel spreadsheet. The core technologies used in this project include Python, TensorFlow, and PyTesseract OCR.

Python: The primary programming language for implementing the entire system.

TensorFlow: Utilized for machine learning tasks, particularly to enhance the accuracy of handwritten text recognition.

PyTesseract OCR: Used for optical character recognition to convert handwritten text from the forms into digital text.

The workflow of the project is as follows:

Image Preprocessing: Scanned images of handwritten forms are preprocessed to improve OCR accuracy.

Text Extraction: PyTesseract OCR is applied to the preprocessed images to extract handwritten text.

Data Organization: The extracted text is structured and organized.

Excel Export: The structured data is saved into an Excel spreadsheet for further use and analysis.

This system aims to streamline the admission process by reducing manual data entry efforts and improving overall efficiency.
